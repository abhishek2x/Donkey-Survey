# Optimisation Techniques üß† 

## Implemented ‚úÖ
* Database Optimisation: Reducing SQL Queries (Most costly operation).
* Static File compression using WhiteNoise.
* Using Conditional Get Middleware or GZIP Middleware(`django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware`)
* Writing Efficient Code
    * There are three prominent ways to lift the efficiency of the code:
        * Upgrading/Replacing the third-party packages
        * Simplifying the code
        * Restructuring the code
* SQL Logging
* Debug Toolbar: To monitor activities

## Further Improvements ‚è≤Ô∏è

* Using a Caching Framework.
* Laziness to avoid computation in the first place. 
* QuerySets Specific Function
    * select_related()
    * prefetch_related()
* Enabling Memcached Server
* Using Elastic Search
